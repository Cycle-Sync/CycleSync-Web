// This is a placeholder for the dashboard page.
// You can expand this with charts, stats, and other insights as needed.
// Consider using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for visualizations.
// For now, it simply displays a title and a placeholder paragraph.
// You can also integrate with your backend API to fetch real data later.
// Make sure to handle loading states and errors gracefully when you implement data fetching.
// This page will be part of the authenticated user flow, so ensure it is protected by your auth middleware.
// You can also add navigation links to other parts of the app, like cycle tracking, settings, etc.
// As you build out the app, consider adding more components to enhance the user experience.
// For example, you might want to include a summary of the user's current cycle,
// upcoming period dates, or recent symptoms logged.
// You can also think about adding user preferences or settings that can be adjusted from this page.
// Don't forget to test the responsiveness of this page on different screen sizes.
// You can use Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile.
// As you continue developing, keep an eye on performance and optimize where necessary.
// Consider lazy loading components or using React's Suspense for better performance.
// This page serves as a foundation for your dashboard, so feel free to iterate and improve it over time.
// You can also gather user feedback to see what features they would find most useful.
// Remember to keep your code organized and maintainable as you add more features.
// Use comments to explain complex logic or important decisions in your code.
// As you expand the app, consider implementing state management solutions like Redux or Context API if needed.
// This will help you manage global state across different components and pages.
