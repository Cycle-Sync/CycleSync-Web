// This page will display a radial calendar view of the user's menstrual cycle.
// You can use libraries like react-calendar or d3.js to create an interactive calendar.
// Consider fetching the user's cycle data from your backend API and rendering it in a visually appealing way.
// You might also want to allow users to click on specific days to log symptoms or view details.
// Make sure to handle loading states and errors gracefully when fetching data.
// As you build this out, think about how you can make the calendar intuitive and easy tco use.
// You can also consider adding features like highlighting the current day, upcoming period dates, or ovulation days.
// Don't forget to test the responsiveness of this page on different screen sizes.
// Use Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile.
// As you continue developing, keep an eye on performance and optimize where necessary.
